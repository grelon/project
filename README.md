# Bunqer
*By Sander Swierts*  

Final project for Minor Programmeren
  
This app gives an overview of what you spend your money on if you are a Bunq customer. Categorize new transactions once and after that, they are categorized automatically. Simply share a CSV (semi-colon seperated) of your transaction statement with this app and you're good to go.

Disclaimer: Me nor this project is affiliated with Bunq. I am merely an enthousiastic customer.
